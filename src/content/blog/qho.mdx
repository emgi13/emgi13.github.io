## Figures

### Figure 1: 2D Plot of $|\Psi|$ vs $x$, Animated by Time

![.](/assets/qho/abs.gif)

This figure shows the absolute value of the wave function as a function of position. It is animated over time to illustrate the evolution of the state.

### Figure 2: 3D Plot of $\text{Re}(\Psi)$, $\text{Im}(\Psi)$, $x$, Animated by Time

This figure provides a 3D visualization of the real and imaginary parts of the wave function. The animation shows how these components change over time.

### Figure 3: 3D Plot of Eigenstates and Their Rotation as a Function of Time

This figure depicts the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. It shows how these states rotate over time while maintaining their orthonormality.

- Time Dependent Shrodinger Equation
  - $i \hbar \frac{\partial \ket{\Psi } }{\partial t} = \hat{H} \ket{\Psi }$
  - $\hat{H}$ is the hamiltonian
    - $\hat{H} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla ^2     + \hat{V}$
- Basis
  - we use the descrete orthonormal basis. the basis is formed by the eigenstates of the
    position operator $\hat{X}$
  - Construction
    - split the interval $\left[ 0,1 \right] $ into $N$ points
      - $\Delta x = \frac{1}{N-1}$
      - $x_{i}=i\cdot \Delta x \quad \forall i \in \left\{ 0,\ldots ,1 \right\}$
    - dot product
      - $\braket{i|j}=\delta _{ij}$
  - Representation
    - $\ket{i}$ represents the point at $x_{i}$
    - can be represented as the column vector
      $\left( 0 \ldots  1 \ldots  0 \right)$, where the $1$ is at the ith position
  - any state $\Psi(x)$ can be represented as $\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} c_n \ket{n}$
    where $c_n = \Psi(x_n)$
  - any operator $\hat{O}$ can be represented in the form of a matrix
    - $O_{ij} = \bra{i} \hat{O} \ket{j}$
    - Eg: Identity $\hat{I}$
      - $I_{ij} = \bra{i} \hat{I} \ket{j} = \braket{i|j} = \delta _{ij}$
      - this is the diagonal matrix with all diagonal entries 1
      - this also proves the completeness of our basis
    - Eg: Position $\hat{X}$
      - $X_{ij}=\bra{i}\hat{X}\ket{j}$
      - as $\hat{X}\ket{j} = x_j \ket{j}$
      - $X_{ij}=x_j \braket{i|j}= x_j \delta _{ij}$
      - this is a diagonal matrix with the positions as diagonal entries
- Harmonic Potential
  - what is a harmonic oscillator
  - why is studying it useful
  - $V(x)=\frac{1}{2}m \omega ^2 (x-\frac{1}{2})^2$
  - $\hat{V}=\frac{1}{2}m \omega ^2 \left[\hat{X}-\hat{I}/2\right]^2$
- Laplacian operator $\hat{\nabla ^2} $
  - To approximate the laplacian in our basis, we can use the secant-line method
  - $\frac{\partial ^2 }{\partial x^2} \approx \frac{x_{i+1}+x_{i-1}-2x_{i}}{{\Delta x} ^2}$
  - $\hat{\nabla ^2} \approx \sum_n \frac{\ket{n+1}\bra{n}+\ket{n-1}\bra{n}-2\ket{n}\bra{n}}{{\Delta x}^2} $
- We can combine the potential and kinetic energy terms to get the hamiltonian $\hat{H}$
- We can then use Euler's method to evolve the state function
  - $\ket{\Psi'}=\left( \hat{I} - \frac{i}{\hbar}\Delta t \hat{H} \right)\ket{\Psi } $
- But we can do better
  - as our hamiltonian is time independent, we can evaluate $\ket{\Psi (t)}$ directly given $\ket{\Psi (0)}$
  - From TDSE $\frac{\partial \ket{\Psi }}{\partial t} = - \frac{i}{\hbar} \hat{H} \ket{\Psi} $
  - $\frac{\mathrm{d }\ket{\Psi }}{\ket{\Psi }} = -\frac{i \mathrm{dt}}{\hbar} \hat{H}$
