Preparing for an exam can be daunting, but with the right goals, resources, and strategies, you can achieve a top rank. Here's a detailed guide to help you navigate your preparation journey effectively.

## Setting Your Goals

- **Aim for 50 Marks**: Historically, scoring 50 marks guarantees a rank in the top 50.
- **Target 60 Marks**: Achieving 60 marks will likely place you in the sub-20 ranks.
- **Reach for 65 Marks**: With 65 marks, you can expect to be in the top 5-10.

## Recommended Resources

- **Study Material**: I initially purchased "GK Publishing" PYQs and study material. However, I wouldn't recommend it due to numerous typos, sorting through which can be time-consuming and confusing. Instead, consider using study material from "Career Endeavour," which is better edited. You can find some old scans of this material shared in a comment on a [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/physicsguide/posts/1295879177564007/) online.

## Sources for PYQ Solutions

- For previous year solutions, I used the [free downloads](https://www.physicsbyfiziks.com/previous-year-question-paper/) available on "Physics by Fiziks." While some solutions are roundabout, better methods can be devised if you have a good grasp of the subject. I suggest attempting the questions diligently before looking at the solutions online.

## What to Memorize

- By solving PYQs from the past 15 years, you'll notice certain topics are frequently repeated, with some concepts consistently appearing in questions. For example,
  - **Classical Mechanics**: Focus on Lagrangian-Hamiltonian conversion, conserved quantities, and generator functions.
  - **Quantum Mechanics**: Pay attention to modifications to the harmonic oscillator, energy levels of QHO, and degeneracies.
- From each topic (e.g., classical mechanics), you'll find that memorizing about 10-15 key formulas can help you answer most questions in a single step.

## Time Management and Strategy

- If you've solved PYQs, scoring 45 marks in the paper should be straightforward. After quickly solving these, focus on topics you're comfortable with and tackle the longer (usually 2-mark) questions to push your score towards 60 marks.

By setting clear goals, using the right resources, and employing effective strategies, you can maximize your exam performance and achieve a top rank.

Good luck with your preparation!
