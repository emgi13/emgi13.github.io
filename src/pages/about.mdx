# About Me

Hi there! I'm **Mridul Gupta**, but you can call me EmGiXIII (pronounced either phonetically or as "M G 13"). Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm a passionate physics graduate with a keen interest in quantum computation, especially in the fascinating world of adiabatic quantum computation. My journey in academia has been quite the adventure, and I'm excited to share a bit about myself with you.

## Whats EmGiCO

**EmGiCO** is a dream company I wanted to build since I was in 4th grade. It's pronounced "M G Co" and stands for "Mridul Gupta and Company." For now, I have repurposed the company to mean this website/blog, where I share my thoughts and projects.

## A Bit About My Background

### Education

I recently completed my **BS-MS Dual Degree** at the **Indian Institute of Science Education and Research** in Kolkata, where I graduated with a CGPA of 8.29. My master's project was a deep dive into the conversion of prime factorization into a B-SAT problem, which was both challenging and rewarding.

### Future Plans

Now, I'm gearing up for my PhD, where I plan to explore algorithms for solving SAT problems—both quantum and classical.

## Work Experience

### Research Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services

I've had the opportunity to work as a **Research Engineer** at **Tata Consultancy Services** in Mumbai, where I built search tools that utilized fuzzy searching and natural language processing (NLP). I also developed AI-powered web applications that helped accelerate frontend development and curated recommendations for companies based on various tech areas and services they provide.

### Skills Gained

During my time at TCS, I learned best practices such as Test-Driven Development (TDD) and SCRUM, which enhanced my collaboration skills and disciplined me to meet strict deadlines. This experience also fostered my problem-solving abilities and instilled a researcher's attitude and methodology towards tackling new and unresearched problems.

### Teaching Assistant Role

Before that, I served as a **Teaching Assistant** for programming and data structures, as well as an introduction to computation at my alma mater. I thoroughly enjoyed interacting with students who were as enthusiastic about programming as I am.

### Encouraging Advanced Learning

For those students already familiar with coding or who felt limited by the coursework, I encouraged them to tackle more advanced programming tasks and problems. This role helped me develop a sense of what a person grading coursework feels, while still being a student myself. Teaching was a fantastic experience that allowed me to share my love for physics and computation with others.

## Skills & Interests

### Programming Proficiency

I’m proficient in several programming languages, including Python, TypeScript, and Rust, and I love using libraries like Matplotlib and NumPy to bring my ideas to life. I also enjoy working with frontend frameworks like React and AstroJS.

### Creative Pursuits

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the realms of generative art and digital art. Some of my digital art can be found on my Instagram [@emgixiii](https://www.instagram.com/emgixiii). I also enjoy tinkering with esoteric programming languages like Brainf\*ck!

## Achievements

I’m proud to have received the **Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana (KVPY) Fellowship** and to have been a finalist in the **National Round of the Indian National Astronomy Olympiad**. I also ranked 8750 in the IIT-JEE 2018, which was a significant milestone in my academic journey.
