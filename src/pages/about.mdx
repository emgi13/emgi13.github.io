# About Me

Hi there! I'm **Mridul Gupta**, but you can call me EmGiXIII (pronounced either phonetically or as "M G 13"). Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm a passionate physics graduate with a keen interest in quantum computation, especially in the fascinating world of adiabatic quantum computation. My journey in academia has been quite the adventure, and I'm excited to share a bit about myself with you. You can download my resume [here](/Resume.pdf).

## Whats EmGiCO

**EmGiCO** is a dream company I wanted to build since I was in 4th grade. It's pronounced "M G Co" and stands for "Mridul Gupta and Company." For now, I have repurposed the company to mean this website/blog, where I share my thoughts and projects.

## A Bit About My Background

### Education

I recently completed my **BS-MS Dual Degree** at the **Indian Institute of Science Education and Research** in Kolkata, where I graduated with a CGPA of 8.29. My master's project was a deep dive into the conversion of prime factorization into a B-SAT problem, which was both challenging and rewarding.

### Future Plans

Now, I'm gearing up for my PhD, where I plan to explore algorithms for solving SAT problems—both quantum and classical.

## Skills & Interests

### Programming Proficiency

I’m proficient in several programming languages, including Python, TypeScript, and Rust, and I love using libraries like Matplotlib and NumPy to bring my ideas to life. I also enjoy working with frontend frameworks like React and AstroJS.

### Creative Pursuits

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the realms of generative art and digital art. Some of my digital art can be found on my Instagram [@emgixiii](https://www.instagram.com/emgixiii). I also enjoy tinkering with esoteric programming languages like Brainf\*ck!
